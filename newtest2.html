</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="background: #ffff00">It
is understandable that since Prometheus was considered a Titan and
not one of the Olympian gods that there would be an absence of
evidence, with the exception of Athens, for the direct religious
devotion to his worship. Despite his importance to the myths and
imaginative literature of ancient Greece, the religious cult of
Prometheus during the Archaic and Classical periods seems to have
been limited.[38] Writing in the 2nd century AD, the satirist Lucian
points out that while temples to the major Olympians were everywhere,
none to Prometheus is to be seen.[39]</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="background: #ffff00">Athens
was the exception. The altar of Prometheus in the grove of the
Academy was the point of origin for several significant processions
and other events regularly observed on the Athenian calendar. For the
Panathenaic festival, arguably the most important civic festival at
Athens, a torch race began at the altar, which was located outside
the sacred boundary of the city, and passed through the Kerameikos,
the district inhabited by potters and other artisans who regarded
Prometheus and Hephaestus as patrons.[40] The race then traveled to
the heart of the city, where it kindled the sacrificial fire on the
altar of Athena on the Acropolis to conclude the festival.[41] These
footraces took the form of relays in which teams of runners passed
off a flaming torch. According to Pausanias (2nd century AD), the
torch relay, called lampadedromia or lampadephoria, was first
instituted at Athens in honor of Prometheus.[42]</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="background: #ffff00">By
the Classical period, the races were run by ephebes also in honor of
Hephaestus and Athena.[43] Prometheus' association with fire is the
key to his religious significance[38] and to the alignment with
Athena and Hephaestus that was specific to Athens and its &quot;unique
degree of cultic emphasis&quot; on honoring technology.[44] The
festival of Prometheus was the Prometheia. The wreaths worn
symbolized the chains of Prometheus.[45]</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="background: #ffff00">Pausanias
recorded a few other religious sites in Greece devoted to Prometheus.
Both Argos and Opous claimed to be Prometheus' final resting place,
each erecting a tomb in his honor. The Greek city of Panopeus had a
cult statue that was supposed to honor Prometheus for having created
the human race there.</span></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="background: #ffff00">Prometheus
indicts the Gods, and Zeus most of all. Prometheus resents Zeus for
dooming him to this punishment. Cleanthes is offended, and recites
his hymn to Zeus. Prometheus gets him to agree that if his story can
persuade him otherwise, Cleanthes will set Prometheus free. </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="background: #ffff00">Cleanthes
is reluctant to defy the will of Zeus, but Prometheus claims Heracles
is already destined to free him, and Cleanthes would only be saving
him the trouble of waiting. Cleanthes is disgusted at his weakness,
cowardly refusing to own up to his own crime despite the justice of
the sentence being finite. Prometheus says it is not the pain that
troubles him, nor the time, but the fact that even his redemption
will serve only to glorify Heracles as surpassing his own father,
thereby glorifying Zeus himself as the father. </span>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="background: #ffff00">P:
Were you to undo Zeus's judgment, the glory would redound to me, your
creator. Zeus created no man; Hercules he only half-created, after

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="background: #ffff00">He
says he would rather remain imprisoned forever, but he can’t very
well ask Cleanthes to slay Heracles. Heracles as the prototypical
warrior represents the subordination of Prometheus’s creation from
within, by the god-man. Prometheus is destined to be freed anyway,
and so Cleanthes won’t be violating Zeus’s will, for if Zeus
could merely will Heracles’s fate it would not count to Heracles’s
glory to accomplish it. If Cleanthes, a mere man, were to accomplish
Zeus’s will, this would return the glory to Prometheus and thwart
Zeus, and prove that fate outstrips Zeus’s own will, that Zeus can
only will a higher inevitability and seek to realize it on his terms.
Hence, if Prometheus succeeds in his persuasion, Cleanthes would
already have to accept the premise that freeing Prometheus was
consistent with pious virtue. Cleanthes agrees to listen.</span></p>

of Atlas, Menoetius, and Epimetheus (Hes. Theog. 507). His name

denotes &quot;afterthought.&quot; Others call Prometheus a son of

Titan Eurymedon and Hera (Potter, Comment. ad Lyc. Cass. 1283;

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Hesiod revisits the
story of Prometheus in the Works and Days (lines 42–105). Here, the
poet expands upon Zeus's reaction to Prometheus's deception. Not only
does Zeus withhold fire from humanity, but &quot;the means of life,&quot;
as well (42). Had Prometheus not provoked Zeus's wrath (44–47),
&quot;you would easily do work enough in a day to supply you for a
full year even without working; soon would you put away your rudder
over the smoke, and the fields worked by ox and sturdy mule would run

- only survives in Hesiod, with brief mention by Callimachus</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The gods and mortal
man had arranged a meeting at Mecone where the matter of division of
sacrifice between gods and men was to be settled. Prometheus slew a
large ox, and divided it into two piles. In one pile he put all the
meat and most of the fat, skillfully covering it with the ox's
grotesque stomach, while in the other pile, he dressed up the bones
artfully with shining fat. Prometheus then invited Zeus to choose;
Zeus chose the pile of bones. Hesiod describes Zeus as having seen
through the trick, realizing that in purposefully getting tricked he
would have an excuse to vent his anger on mortal man. It may be,
however, that in mainstream versions of the story Zeus was actually
deceived, and that Hesiod is trying to be pious by changing the story
to make Zeus look better.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In the trick at
Mekone, a sacrificial meal marking the &quot;settling of accounts&quot;
between mortals and immortals, Prometheus played a trick against Zeus
(545–557). He placed two sacrificial offerings before the Olympian:
a selection of beef hidden inside an ox's stomach (nourishment hidden
inside a displeasing exterior), and the bull's bones wrapped
completely in &quot;glistening fat&quot; (something inedible hidden
inside a pleasing exterior). Zeus chose the latter, setting a
precedent for future sacrifices.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As an act of
revenge, Zeus hid fire from mankind, leaving them cold and shivering
at night. Prometheus, however, out of pity stole it for them shortly
after, incurring the further wrath of Zeus. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Henceforth, humans
would keep that meat for themselves and burn the bones wrapped in fat
as an offering to the gods. This angered Zeus, who hid fire from
humans in retribution. In this version of the myth, the use of fire
was already known to humans, but withdrawn by Zeus.[6] Prometheus,
however, stole fire back in a giant fennel-stalk and restored it to
humanity.</p>

a reflection of an ancient, pre-Hesiodic trickster-figure, who served
to account for the mixture of good and bad in human life, and whose
fashioning of humanity from clay was an Eastern motif familiar in
Enuma Elish; as an opponent of Zeus he was an analogue of the Titans,
and like them was punished. As an advocate for humanity he gains
semi-divine status at Athens, where the episode in Theogony in which
he is liberated[12] is interpreted by Casanova as a post-Hesiodic

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As summarized by
Raggio, &quot;After the gods have moulded men and other living
creatures with a mixture of clay and fire, the two brothers
Epimetheus and Prometheus are called to complete the task and
distribute among the newly born creatures all sorts of natural
qualities. Epimetheus sets to work, but, being unwise, distributes
all the gifts of nature among the animals, leaving men naked and
unprotected, unable to defend themselves and to survive in a hostile
world. Prometheus then steals the fire of creative power from the
workshop of Athena and Hephaistos and gives it to mankind.&quot;
Raggio then goes on to point out Plato's distinction of creative
power (techne) which is presented as superior to merely natural
instincts (physis).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Some two dozen other
Greek and Roman authors retold and further embellished the Prometheus
myth from as early as the 5th century BCE (Diodorus, Herodorus) into
the 4th century AD. The most significant detail added to the myth
found in, e.g., Sappho, Aesop and Ovid[48] — was the central role
of Prometheus in the creation of the human race. According to these
sources, Prometheus fashioned humans out of clay.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There was also an
account, stating that Prometheus had created men out of earth and
water, at the very beginning of the human race, or after the flood of
Deucalion, when Zeus is said to have ordered him and Athena to make
men out of the mud, and the winds to breathe life into them (Apollod.
i. 7. § 1; Ov. Met. i. 81; Etym. Mag. s. v. Promêtheus). Prometheus
is said to have given to men something of all the qualities possessed
by the other animals (Horat Carm. i. 16. 13). The kind of earth out
of which Prometheus formed men was shown in later times near Panopeus
in Phocis (Paus. x. 4. § 3), and it was at his suggestion that
Deucalion, when the flood approached, built a ship, and carried into
it provisions, that he and Pyrrha might be able to support themselves
during the calamity (Apollod. i. 7. § 2). Prometheus, in the legend,
often appears in connection with Athena, e. g., he is said to have
been punished on mount Caucasus for the criminal love he entertained
for her (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. ii. 1249) and he is further said,
with her assistance, to have ascended into heaven, and there secretly
to have lighted his torch at the chariot of Helios, in order to bring
down the fire to man (Serv. ad Virg. Eclog. vi. 42). At Athens
Prometheus had a sanctuary in the Academy, from whence a torch-race
took place in honour of him (Paus. i. 30. § 2; Schol. ad Soph. Oed.
Col. 55; Harpocrat. s. v. lampas).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In the sixth Nemean
Ode, Pindar states: &quot;There is one/race of men, one race of gods;
both have breath/of life from a single mother. But sundered
power/holds us divided, so that one side is nothing, while on the
other the brazen sky is established/a sure citadel forever.&quot;[19]
Although this duality in strikingly apparent in Pindar, it also has
paradoxical elements where Pindar actually comes quite close to
Hesiod who before him had said in his Works and Days (108) &quot;how
the gods and mortal men sprang from one source.&quot;[20] The
understanding of Prometheus and his role in the creation of humans
and the theft of fire for their benefit is therefore distinctly
adapted within this distinguishable source for understanding the role
of Prometheus within the mythology of the interaction of the Gods
with humans.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">the Late Roman
author Censorinus states in his book titled De die natali that,
&quot;Pythagoras of Samos, Okellos of Lukania, Archytas of Tarentum,
and in general all Pythagoreans were the authors and proponents of
the opinion that the human race was eternal.&quot;[21] By this they
held that Prometheus's creation of humans was the creation of
humanity for eternity. This Pythagorean view is further confirmed in
the book On the Cosmos written by the Pythagorean Okellos of Lukania.
Okellos, in his cosmology, further delineates the three realms of the
cosmos as all contained within an overarching order called the
diakosmesis which is also the world order kosmos, and which also must
be eternal. The three realms were delineated by Okellos as having
&quot;two poles, man on earth, the gods in heaven. Merely for the
sake of symmetry, as it were, the daemons – not evil spirits but
beings intermediate between God and man – occupy a middle position
in the air, the realm between heaven and earth. They were not a
product of Greek mythology, but of the belief in daemons that had
sprung up in various parts of the Mediterranean world and the Near
East.&quot;</p>

Golden Age is the only age that falls within the rule of Cronus.
Created by the immortals who live on Olympus, these humans were said
to live among the gods, and freely mingled with them. Peace and
harmony prevailed during this age. Humans did not have to work to
feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived
to a very old age but with a youthful appearance and eventually died
peacefully. Their spirits live on as &quot;guardians&quot;. Plato in
Cratylus (397e) recounts the golden race of men who came first. He
clarifies that Hesiod did not mean men literally made of gold, but
good and noble. He describes these men as daemons upon the earth.
Since δαίμονες (daimones) is derived from δαήμονες

years under the dominion of their mothers. They lived only a short
time as grown adults, and spent that time in strife with one another.
During this Age men refused to worship the gods and Zeus destroyed
them for their impiety. After death, humans of this age became
&quot;blessed spirits&quot; of the underworld.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Bronze Age – Men
of the Bronze Age were hardened and tough, as war was their purpose
and passion. Zeus created these humans out of the ash tree. Their
armor was forged of bronze, as were their homes, and tools. The men
of this Age were undone by their own violent ways and left no named
spirits; instead, they dwell in the &quot;dank house of Hades&quot;.
This Age came to an end with the flood of Deucalion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Heroic Age – The
Heroic Age is the one age that does not correspond with any metal. It
is also the only age that improves upon the age it follows. It was
the heroes of this Age who fought at Thebes and Troy. This race of
humans died and went to Elysium.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Iron Age – Hesiod
finds himself in the Iron Age. During this age humans live an
existence of toil and misery. Children dishonor their parents,
brother fights with brother and the social contract between guest and
host (xenia) is forgotten. During this age might makes right, and bad
men use lies to be thought good. At the height of this age, humans no
longer feel shame or indignation at wrongdoing; babies will be born
with gray hair and the gods will have completely forsaken humanity:
&quot;there will be no help against evil.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The Roman poet Ovid
(1st century BC – 1st century AD) tells a similar myth of Four Ages
in Book 1.89–150 of the Metamorphoses. His account is similar to
Hesiod's with the exception that he omits the Heroic Age. Ovid
emphasizes the justice and peace that defined the Golden Age. He adds
that in this age, men did not yet know the art of navigation and
therefore did not explore the larger world, no man had knowledge of
any arts but pre agriculture. In the Silver Age, Jupiter introduces
the seasons and men consequentially learn the art of agriculture and
architecture. In the Bronze Age, Ovid writes, men were prone to
warfare, but not impiety. Finally, in the Iron Age, men demarcate
nations with boundaries; they learn the arts of navigation and
mining; they are warlike, greedy and impious. Truth, modesty and
loyalty are nowhere to be found.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The banishment of
the warring Titans by the Olympians to the chthonic depths of
Tartarus was documented as early as Homer's Iliad and the Odyssey
where they are also identified as the hypotartarioi, or, the
&quot;subterranean.&quot; The passages appear in the Iliad (XIV
279)[15] and also in the Homeric hymn to Apollo (335).[16] The
particular forms of violence associated especially with the Titans
are those of hybristes and atasthalie as further found in the Iliad
(XIII 633-34). They are used by Homer to designate an unlimited,
violent insolence among the warring Titans which only Zeus was able
to ultimately overcome. This text finds direct parallel in Hesiod's
reading in the Theogony (209) and in Homer's own Odyssey (XIX 406).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">the origin of the
naming of the Titans as a group has been disputed with some voicing a
preference for reading it as a combination of titainein (to exert),
and, titis (retribution) usually rendered as &quot;retribution meted
out to the exertion of the Titans.&quot;[18] It should be noted in
studying material concerning Prometheus that Prometheus was not
directly among the Titans warring with Zeus though Prometheus's
association with them by lineage is a recurrent theme in each of his
subsequent confrontations with Zeus and with the Olympian gods.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Prometheus, himself
a Titan, managed to avoid being in the direct confrontational cosmic
battle between Zeus and the other Olympians against Cronus and the
other Titans.[4] Prometheus therefore survived the struggle in which
the offending Titans were eternally banished by Zeus to the chthonic
depths of Tartarus, only to survive to confront Zeus on his own terms
in subsequent climactic struggles. The greater Titanomachia depicts
an overarching metaphor of the struggle between generations, between
parents and their children, symbolic of the generation of parents
needing to eventually give ground to the growing needs, vitality, and
responsibilities of the new generation for the perpetuation of
society and survival interests of the human race as a whole.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The larger scope of
Aeschylus as a dramatist revisiting the myth of Prometheus in the age
of Athenian prominence has been discussed by William Lynch.[25]
Lynch's general thesis concerns the rise of humanist and secular
tendencies in Athenian culture and society which required the growth
and expansion of the mythological and religious tradition as acquired
from the most ancient sources of the myth stemming from Hesiod.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Prometheus's
punishment was to be chained to a rock and have an eagle (or a
vulture by some variants) pick out his liver every day for eons,
until Heracles slew the eagle, releasing Prometheus from his
affliction. The Theogony text is ambiguous about whether Prometheus
was freed or remained chained to the rock, but lines 615-616 are
usually interpreted as indicating that he remained bound.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Prometheus, in
eternal punishment, is chained to a rock in the Caucasus,Kazbek
Mountain or Mountain of Khvamli, where his liver is eaten daily by an
eagle,[7] only to be regenerated by night, due to his immortality.
The eagle is a symbol of Zeus himself. Years later, the Greek hero
Heracles (Hercules) slays the eagle and frees Prometheus from the
eagle's torment.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Aeschylus, in his
trilogy Prometheus, added various new features to it, for, according
to him, Prometheus himself is an immortal god, the friend of the
human race, the giver of fire, the inventor of the useful arts, an
omniscient seer, an heroic sufferer, who is overcome by the superior
power of Zeus, but will not bend his inflexible mind. Although he
himself belonged to the Titans, he is nevertheless represented as
having assisted Zeus against the Titans (Prom. 218), and he is
further said to have opened the head of Zeus when the latter gave
birth to Athena (Apollod. i. 3. § 6). But when Zeus succeeded to the
kingdom of heaven, and wanted to extirpate the whole race of man, the
place of which he proposed to give to quite a new race of beings,
Prometheus prevented the execution of the scheme, and saved the human
race from destruction (Prom. 228, 233). He deprived them of their
knowledge of the future, and gave them hope instead (248, &amp;c.).
He further taught them the use of fire, made them acquainted with
architecture, astronomy, mathematics, the art of writing, the
treatment of domestic animals, navigation, medicine, the art of
prophecy, working in metal, and all the other arts (252, 445, &amp;c.,
480, &amp;c.). But, as in all these things he had acted contrary to
the will of Zeus, the latter ordered Hephaestus to chain him to a
rock in Scythia, which was done in the presence of Cratos and Bia,
two ministers of Zeus. In Scythia he was visited by the Oceanides; Io
also came to him, and he foretold her the wanderings and sufferings
which were yet in store for her, as well as her final relief (703,
&amp;c.). Hermes then likewise appears, and desires him to make known
a prophecy which was of great importance to Zeus, for Prometheus knew
that by a certain woman Zeus would beget a son, who was to dethrone
his father, and Zeus wanted to have a more accurate knowledge of this
decree of fate. But Prometheus steadfastly refused to reveal the
decree of fate, whereupon Zeus, by a thunderbolt, sent Prometheus,
together with the rock to which he was chained, into Tartarus (Horat.
Carm. ii. 18, 35). After the lapse of a long time, Prometheus
returned to the upper world, to endure a fresh course of suffering,
for he was now fastened to mount Caucasus, and tormented by an eagle,
which every day, or every third day, devoured his liver, which was
restored again in the night (Apollon. Rhod. ii. 1247, &amp;c. iii.
853; Strab. xv. p. 688 ; Philostr. Vit. Apoll. ii. 3; Hygin. Poet.
Astr. ii. 15; Aeschyl. Prom. 1015, &amp;c.). This state of suffering
was to last until some other god, of his own accord, should take his
place, and descend into Tartarus for him (Prom. 1025). This came to
pass when Cheiron, who had been incurably wounded by an arrow of
Heracles, desired to go into Hades; and Zeus allowed him to supply
the place of Prometheus (Apollod. ii. 5. § 4; comp. Cheiron).
According to others, however, Zeus himself delivered Prometheus, when
at length the Titan was prevailed upon to reveal to Zeus the decree
of fate, that, if he should become by Thetis the either of a son,
that son should deprive him of the sovereignty. (Serv. ad Virg.
Eclog. vi. 42 ; Apollod. iii. 13. § 5; Hygin. Fab. 54; comp.
Aeschyl. Prom. 167, &amp;c. 376.)</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Prometheus himself
was put in chains, and fastened to a pillar, where an eagle sent by
Zeus consumed in the daytime his liver, which, in every succeeding
night, was restored again. Prometheus was thus exposed to perpetual
torture, but Heracles killed the eagle and delivered the sufferer,
with the consent of Zeus, who thus had an opportunity of allowing his
son to gain immortal fame (Hes. Theog. 521, &amp;c., Op. et Dies, 47,
&amp;c. ; Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 15; Apollod. ii. 5. § 11)</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Finally, just as
Aeschylus gave Prometheus a key role in bringing Zeus to power, he
also attributed to him secret knowledge that could lead to Zeus's
downfall: Prometheus had been told by his mother Themis, who in the
play is identified with Gaia (Earth), of a potential marriage that
would produce a son who would overthrow Zeus. Fragmentary evidence
indicates that Heracles, as in Hesiod, frees the Titan in the
trilogy's second play, Prometheus Unbound. It is apparently not until
Prometheus reveals this secret of Zeus's potential downfall that the
two reconcile in the final play, Prometheus the Fire-Bringer or
Prometheus Pyrphoros, a lost tragedy by Aeschylus.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">For generations,
scholars warred incessantly over 'the justice of Zeus,'
unintentionally blurring it with a monotheism imported from
Judeo-Christian thought. The playwright undoubtedly had religious
concerns; for instance, Jacqueline de Romilly[28] suggests that his
treatment of time flows directly out of his belief in divine justice.
But it would be an error to think of Aeschylus as sermonizing. His
Zeus does not arrive at decisions which he then enacts in the mortal
world; rather, human events are themselves an enactment of divine
will.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">According to Thomas
Rosenmeyer regarding the religious import of Aeschylus, &quot;In
Aeschylus, as in Homer, the two levels of causation, the supernatural
and the human, are co-existent and simultaneous, two way of
describing the same event.&quot; Rosenmeyer insists that ascribing
portrayed characters in Aeschylus should not conclude them to be
either victims or agents of theological or religious activity too
quickly. As Rosenmeyer states: &quot;[T]he text defines their being.
For a critic to construct an Aeschylean theology would be as quixotic
as designing a typology of Aeschylean man. The needs of the drama
prevail.&quot;</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In a rare comparison
of Prometheus in Aeschylus with Oedipus in Sophocles, Harold Bloom
with more than simple irony has quoted Freud as stating that, &quot;Freud
called Oedipus an 'immoral play,' since the gods ordained incest and
parricide. Oedipus therefore participates in our universal
unconscious sense of guilt, but on this reading so do the gods. I
(states Bloom) sometimes wish that Freud had turned to Aeschylus
instead, and given us the Prometheus complex rather than the Oedipus
complex.&quot;</p>
